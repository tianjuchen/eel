# In this test, an electrode-electrolyte is considered. The electrode x = [0, 0.5]
# and the electrolyte x = [0.5, 1] share an interface at x = 0.5. The electric potential
# on the left is prescribed to be 1, the electric potential on the right is prescribed
# to be 0. The Butler-Volmer condition is enforced at the interface to model redox.
# Parameters are chosen to yield a simple analytical solution:
#                  exchange current density i0 = 1
#   anodic charge transfer coefficient alpha_a = 1
# cathodic charge transfer coefficient alpha_c = 1
#                         Faraday's constant F = 1
#                         ideal gas constant R = 1
#                                temperature T = 1
#                  electric conductivity sigma = 1
# With these parameters, the analytical solution for the electric potential is
# Phi = - 1.8141 x + 1, x = [0, 0.5]
#     = - 1.8141 x + 1.8141, x = [0.5, 1]
# Hence the jump in electric potential is -0.8141.
